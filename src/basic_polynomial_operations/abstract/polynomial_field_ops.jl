#= TASK LIST:
NOTE - the following functions will NOT work when C is an integer until you 
finish implementing all tasks (and even then, some functions such as gcd simply
cannot be implemented over the ring of integers - see bonus task 3 for details).

TODO (Task 2) 
    In this task, simply edit this file such that the first argument (::Type{C})
    to each function is also the type of the coefficients of the polynomials.
    I.e., we want the type signatures to contain:
        {C, D, P <: Polynomial{C, D}}

TODO (Task 6)
    In this task, override the unimplemented functions (after duplicating this 
    file as per the instructions) for C <: ZModP. When overriding, use the
    corresponding _mod_p function as a guide.

TODO (Task 7)
    Here, (in the duplicated file as per the instructions) override the factor
    function for C <: Integer and implement the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).

leading coefficient.

"""
Yun's algorithm to compute a square free polynomial can be performed over any so-called
`perfect field`. All the usual fields you would have worked with are perfect. In particular,
any field with characteristic zero, or finite fields (i.e., Zp) are perfect fields. Thus,
we apply Yun's algorithm.

Precondition: C represents a perfect field.

Note: to account for the case of fields with characteristic p (e.g., Zp), we first divide
by the minimum degree to remove extraneous factors of x. These can cause issues due to the 
following lemma:

Lemma:
Given F a characteristic zero or finite field and f a polynomial in F[x],
    1) If char(F) = 0 then: f' = 0 implies f is constant
    2) If char(F) > 0 then: f' = 0 implies f has a factor of x^char(F)
